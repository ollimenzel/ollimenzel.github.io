[{"content":"In today\u0026rsquo;s rapidly evolving business landscape, collaboration and data-driven decision-making have become paramount. Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s Power Platform empowers organizations to create custom apps, automate workflows, and derive insights from data, all without requiring extensive coding skills. As businesses strive for greater efficiency and agility, the need to collaborate seamlessly within a secure environment has become crucial. One effective way to achieve this is by sharing Power Platform environments with security groups.\nSharing Power Platform Environments with Security Groups Sharing a Power Platform environment with a security group is a strategic approach that streamlines collaboration and enhances security. By associating users with specific security groups, administrators can ensure that the right people have access to the right resources, eliminating the complexities of individual user management. Here\u0026rsquo;s a step-by-step guide to sharing a Power Platform environment with a security group:\nStep 1: Set Up Security Groups Before sharing your Power Platform environment, establish security groups within your organization\u0026rsquo;s Entra ID (aka Azure Active Directory (AAD)). These groups can be based on roles, departments, projects, or any other relevant criteria. This step ensures that you can easily manage access permissions for a group of users instead of dealing with each user individually.\nStep 2: Access Environment Settings Within the Power Platform admin center, navigate to the environment you want to share. Open the environment settings, where you\u0026rsquo;ll find the \u0026ldquo;Access control\u0026rdquo; section. Step 3: Add Security Groups In the \u0026ldquo;Access control\u0026rdquo; section, you\u0026rsquo;ll see an Teams options to add security groups. There click on Create team. Select the Team Type \u0026ldquo;Microsoft Entra Identity Security Group\u0026rdquo; security group(s) you want to grant access to. This will grant all members of the security group access to the environment without the need for separate invitations. There you can also select the Membership type for the security group. This defines which part of your (Security) Group will get access. The access levels are:\nMembers and guests Members Owners Guests Fill out the other fields and click on Next. Step 4: Manage Security roles Power Platform provides various access levels, such as System Admin, Environment Maker, etc. Choose the appropriate access level for the security group members based on their responsibilities and requirements. Step 5: Save Changes After configuring the access settings, make sure to save your changes. The security group members will now be able to collaborate within the shared environment based on their assigned access levels.\nBenefits of Sharing with Security Groups 1. Streamlined Collaboration By sharing environments with security groups, organizations can optimize their resource allocation. Access to apps, data, and workflows can be controlled at a granular level, ensuring that users only have access to the resources they need. This reduces the risk of unauthorized data access or unintended modifications.\n3. Enhanced Security Security is a top priority in any digital workspace. Sharing environments with security groups enforces consistent access controls, reducing the chances of data breaches or unauthorized system changes. When a user\u0026rsquo;s role changes or they leave the organization, their access can be easily revoked by adjusting their security group membership.\n4. Scalability and Flexibility As organizations grow and evolve, their collaboration needs change as well. Sharing with security groups offers scalability and flexibility. New members can be added to security groups, granting them instant access to the appropriate resources. Additionally, security group memberships can be adjusted dynamically to accommodate changing team compositions.\n5. Simplified Administration Managing permissions for each user individually can be a time-consuming task. Sharing with security groups streamlines administration, as access settings are applied collectively to all group members. This frees up administrators to focus on more strategic tasks.\nIn conclusion, sharing a Power Platform environment with security groups is a smart strategy for enhancing collaboration, security, and efficiency. By leveraging this approach, organizations can streamline user management, optimize resource allocation, and foster a secure and productive digital workspace. As businesses continue to adapt to the demands of modern work, embracing collaborative solutions like Power Platform and security group sharing is a key step toward success.\n","date":"2023-08-21T11:37:23+02:00","image":"https://www.menzel.it/post/2023/08/environmentsecuritygroups/SCR-20230822-kbzs-2_hud6ea2a34c0340bef7f9049ba72ad4486_1269955_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://www.menzel.it/post/2023/08/environmentsecuritygroups/","title":"Simplifying Collaboration: Sharing Power Platform Environments with Security Groups"},{"content":"PowerApps is a powerful tool that allows you to create custom business applications without the need for coding. One of the ways you can enhance your PowerApps is by using Graph API calls to the search endpoint \u0026ldquo;https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/search/query\". In this blog post, we\u0026rsquo;ll show you how to do this using the Office365Groups.HttpRequest and the preview feature \u0026ldquo;ParseJSON function and untyped objects\u0026rdquo;.\nPre-requisites Before we get started, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to activate the preview feature \u0026ldquo;ParseJSON function and untyped objects\u0026rdquo; in your PowerApps settings. To do this, go to the Settings menu, browse to Upcoming features, and turn on the setting called ParseJSON function and untyped objects. If this feature is not turned on, the ParseJSON function will not be found in the formula bar. You need to add the Office365Groups connector to your PowerApps. To do this, go to the Data menu, and select Office 365 Groups. This will add the connector to your PowerApps. Using Office365Groups.HttpRequest The Office365Groups.HttpRequest allows you to make HTTP requests to external services from within your PowerApps. This can be useful when you want to retrieve data from an external source, such as the Graph API.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example of how you might use Office365Groups.HttpRequest to search for a message by its subject:\n1 Set(varRequestBody,\u0026#34;{\u0026#34;\u0026#34;requests\u0026#34;\u0026#34;: [{\u0026#34;\u0026#34;entityTypes\u0026#34;\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;\u0026#34;query\u0026#34;\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;\u0026#34;queryString\u0026#34;\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;subject:Hello\u0026#34;\u0026#34;}}]}\u0026#34;); The code above sets a variable named varRequestBody. The JSON object contains a single property named requests .The object in the array represent the search request and contains two properties: entityTypes and query. The entityTypes property a string that specifies the type of entity to search for. In this case, the entity type specified is message (Email\u0026rsquo;s). The query property is an object that contains a single property named queryString. The queryString property is a string that specifies the search query to execute. In this case, the search query is subject:Hello.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 Set(varFile, \u0026#34;data:text/plain;base64,\u0026#34;

This is done by first converting the varRequestBody variable to binary format, then to Base64 format. The resulting Base64 string is then used as the request body for the HTTP request.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Set( varResult, Office365Groups.HttpRequest( \u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/search/query\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;, varFile ) ) The HTTP request is sent to the Microsoft Graph API\u0026rsquo;s search endpoint (https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/search/query) using the Office365Groups.HttpRequest function. The function takes three arguments: the URL of the endpoint, the HTTP method to use (in this case, POST), and the request body to send with the request. This whole code can for example be put in a buttons OnSelect property to send the request when the button is clicked.\nShowing the Results in a Gallery Once we\u0026rsquo;ve made our HTTP request and retrieved the result, we can use a gallery to display the results. To do this, we\u0026rsquo;ll need to insert a gallery control to our App and set the Items property of the gallery to the following. To be able to work with those results, we need to get the resonse body from the HTTP request. This is done by doing one of the following:\nMake the same call in the Graph Explorer and exam the response body from there In PowerApps start the App - Monitor to get the response body from there 1 Table(Index(Table(Index(Table(varResult.value),1).Value.hitsContainers),1).Value.hits) The varResult variable is containing the response from the API. The response is expected to be a JSON object that contains a property named value. The value property is an array of objects that represent the search results.\nThe code uses the Table function to convert the varResult.value array to a table. The resulting table has a single column named Column1 that contains the search results. The Index function is then used to extract the first element of the Column1 array, which is another table. This table represents the hitsContainers property of the search results.\nThe Index function is used again to extract the first element of the hitsContainers table, which is another table. This table represents the hits property of the search results. Finally, the Table function is used again to convert the hits table to a table that can be displayed in the output pane of Visual Studio Code.\nNext, we\u0026rsquo;ll need to add a label control to the gallery and set its Text property to the following:\n1 ThisItem.Value.resource.subject In a gallery, each item is represented by a record that contains one or more fields. The ThisItem function is used to reference the current item in the gallery.\nIf we look at the output of the Table function, we can see that each item in the gallery is represented by a record that contains a resource field. The resource field is an object that contains a subject field.\nTherefore, ThisItem.Value.resource.subject is used to extract the subject of the resource from the current search result and display it in the label control.\nConclusion In this blog post, I\u0026rsquo;ve shown you how to use Graph API calls to Microsoft Search in PowerApps by using the Office365Groups.HttpRequest and the preview feature \u0026ldquo;ParseJSON function and untyped objects\u0026rdquo;.

This results in the variations not being displayed correctly on the site.\nTo fix this issue, you can use PowerShell to reconnect the pages with their language variations. In this blog post, we\u0026rsquo;ll walk through the PowerShell code for doing this.\nStep-by-Step Explanation of the Code Here\u0026rsquo;s a step-by-step explanation of the PowerShell code for reconnecting pages with language variations after copying them with ShareGate:\nFirst, we need to connect to the SharePoint site where the pages are located. We can do this using the Connect-PnPOnline cmdlet: 1 Connect-PnPOnline -Url \u0026#34;https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/MySite\u0026#34; Next, we need to get a list of all the pages in the site. We can do this using the Get-PnPFolderItem cmdlet with the right language folder: 1 $Files = Get-PnPFolderItem -FolderSiteRelativeUrl SitePages/de This code gets a list of all the pages in the \u0026ldquo;Site Pages\u0026rdquo; language folder.\nNow that we have a list of all the pages, we need to loop through each page and reconnect its language variations. We can do this using a foreach loop: 1 2 3 foreach ($Page in $Pages) { # Reconnect language variations for the page } Inside the foreach loop, we need to get the default file for the page. We can do this using the Get-PnPFile cmdlet: 1 $DefaultFile = Get-PnPFile -Url \u0026#34;SitePages/$($Page.Name)\u0026#34; -AsListItem This code gets the default Page by using the Name property from the $Page object.\nNext, we need to get additional informations from the language variations of the page. We can do this using the Get-PnPListItem cmdlet: 1 $LangFile = Get-PnPFile -Url SitePages/$Language/$($Page.Name) -AsListItem This code gets a information about language variations page by filtering the pages in the \u0026ldquo;Site Pages\u0026rdquo; library by Folder $Language-Variable and the $Page.Name.\nNow that we have all the information we need, we can reconnect the language variations to the default file. We can do this using the Set-PnPListItem cmdlet: 1 2 #Set the Default Item field Set-PnPListItem -List SitePages -Identity $DefaultFile.Id -Values @{\u0026#34;_SPTranslatedLanguages\u0026#34; = $LangISO} 1 2 #Set the Language Item fields Set-PnPListItem -List SitePages -Identity $LangFile.Id -Values @{\u0026#39;_SPIsTranslation\u0026#39; = \u0026#39;1\u0026#39;; \u0026#39;_SPTranslationLanguage\u0026#39; = $LangISO; \u0026#39;_SPTranslationSourceItemId\u0026#39; = $DefaultFile.FieldValues.UniqueId } This code sets the _SPTranslationSourceItemId property of the variation file to the GUID of the default file.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it! We\u0026rsquo;ve now looped through all the pages and their language variations, and reconnected them to each other. Conclusion In this blog post, we\u0026rsquo;ve walked through the PowerShell code for reconnecting pages with language variations after copying them with ShareGate. By using this code, you can ensure that the language variations are properly connected to each other, and that they are displayed correctly on the site.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the complete PowerShell script for reconnecting pages with language variations after copying them with ShareGate:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 $SiteCollection = \u0026#34;https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/SiteCollection\u0026#34; $Language = \u0026#34;de\u0026#34; $LangISO = \u0026#34;de-de\u0026#34; #Create Connection Connect-PnPOnline -Url $SiteCollection -Interactive #Get all aspx pages within Folder DE in Library SitePages $Pages = Get-PnPFolderItem -FolderSiteRelativeUrl SitePages/$Language #Loop through all files and get the file object from the files with the same name in the root directory foreach ($Page in $Pages) { $DefaultFile = Get-PnPFile -Url SitePages/$($Page.Name) -AsListItem $LangFile = Get-PnPFile -Url SitePages/$Language/$($Page.Name) -AsListItem #Set the Default Item field Set-PnPListItem -List SitePages -Identity $DefaultFile.Id -Values @{\u0026#34;_SPTranslatedLanguages\u0026#34; = $LangISO} #Set the German Language Item fields Set-PnPListItem -List SitePages -Identity $LangFile.Id -Values @{\u0026#39;_SPIsTranslation\u0026#39; = \u0026#39;1\u0026#39;; \u0026#39;_SPTranslationLanguage\u0026#39; = $LangISO; \u0026#39;_SPTranslationSourceItemId\u0026#39; = $DefaultFile.FieldValues.UniqueId } } ","date":"2023-07-27T11:57:41+02:00","image":"https://www.menzel.it/post/2023/07/reconnect_pages/Reconnect_hu58e59d2a09840853c5e0830e43305ea7_1183462_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://www.menzel.it/post/2023/07/reconnect_pages/","title":"Reconnecting Pages with Language Variations After Copying Them with ShareGate"},{"content":"Simplifying File Management with OneDrive: Add to OneDrive vs. Team Site Sync\nOneDrive offers convenient file management and collaboration features, including Add to OneDrive and Team Site Sync.

Simply locate the desired folder, select the Folders tile, and choose \u0026ldquo;Add Shortcut to My Files.\u0026rdquo; This creates a shortcut for quick access.\nThis feature is particularly useful for accessing files across devices related to collaborative projects. It provides centralized access regardless of your location, improving efficiency and reducing clicks.\nTeam Site Sync: Comprehensive File Synchronization Team Site Sync also allows you syncing files from OneDrive, SharePoint, and Teams.\nTeam Site Sync syncs specific folders or libraries, but it is limited to the device where synchronization occurred.\nChoosing Between Add to OneDrive and Team Site Sync For most scenarios, Add to OneDrive is recommended due to its enhanced capabilities and future development. If your organization isn\u0026rsquo;t extensively using Team Site Sync, it\u0026rsquo;s advisable to prioritize Add to OneDrive exclusively.\nIf your organization currently employs both features, Microsoft plans to provide guidance on migrating from Team Site Sync to Add to OneDrive gradually.\nDisabling the Sync Button To streamline the file synchronization experience and promote Add to OneDrive, you can disable the sync button for the entire site using the following code:\n1 Set-SPOTenant -HideSyncButtonOnTeamSite $true This script helps IT administrators guide users towards Add to OneDrive and encourages its adoption.\n","date":"2023-05-16T16:38:45+02:00","image":"https://www.menzel.it/post/2023/05/add_to_onedrive/Main_hu502c155179e040f10273bd58ace348bd_299354_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://www.menzel.it/post/2023/05/add_to_onedrive/","title":"Simplifying File Management with OneDrive: Add to OneDrive vs. Team Site Sync"},{"content":"SharePoint Online is a powerful collaboration tool that allows users to share documents and collaborate with others.
